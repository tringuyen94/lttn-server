## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher) or yarn

## Usage

After starting the server, the API will be available at `http://localhost:<PORT>` (default port is 3000). Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints.

---

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Refer to the `.env.example` file for available options:

```env
PORT=3000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/my-database
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

- `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the server with live reload for development.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
